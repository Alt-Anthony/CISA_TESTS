## According to DHS, defense-in-depth can be defined as:
The practice of using specific countermeasures implemented in layers.
## What should implemented defense-in-depth measures do?
Buy you time to detect and respond to a breach, reducing impact.
## For defense-in-depth to work, people must be trained and aware of the security environment and reduce at-risk behavior to an acceptable level.
True
## What are the 5 defense-in-depth layers for defending your ICS?
Security management, physical, network, hardware and software security
## Defense-in-depth is a layered approach that requires you to develop defenses for some systems and subsystems.
False
## Creating a baseline is simple, and once you are done it is complete.
False
## When creating a baseline, you should look at which of the following? (Select all that apply)
Audit what you have and document it to help establish your baseline,
Understand and implement your policies,
Identify your ICS components,Idenfity 
improvements to your network,Prioritize improvements to your network

## Why did DHS develop the CSET® tool?
To assess critical infrastructure and the security posture of the control systems at critical infrastructure facilities.
##  What does the CSET® tool help with?
Providing solutions, recommendations, and best practices
## Constant improvements to your baseline are necessary, because attack vectors change each time a new vulnerability is discovered.
True
## What should a complex password include?
Upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
## What does two-factor authentication require?
All of the above
## What types of exercises should be used to test an incident response plan?
Structured walk through, simulation test, and full interruption test
## What factors drive ICS system changes? (Select all that apply)
Process equipment modifications and additions,Operational changes,Software fixes
## What are the steps to retire an ICS?
Design, implementation, and operation
## The second layer in the defense-in-depth model is?
Physical Security
## Physical security is an important defense-in-depth layer, because an attacker can compromise a system with less effort if they have physical access to the components.
True
## What should policies and procedures stipulate?
All of the above
## What does physical security include?
Limited building access, off-site backup centers, and server rooms
## What unwanted physical access or theft of ICS components does physical security refer to preventing?
Servers, workstations, laptops, and networking equipment
