## Any hardware or software processing, storing, or transmitting information digitally is vulnerable to cyberattack.
True
## Which of the following are vulnerable to a cyber adversary? (Select all that apply.)
Networking and remote access devices,
Programmable logic controllers,
Data acquisition servers and historians,
Engineering workstations,
Authentication and authorization servers
## In ICS, poor code quality may result because _____ is the top priority, not _____.
availability, security
## While Web-based and remote services are efficient, they may introduce _____ into the control system.
security vulnerabilities
## Because a good trust relationship typically exists between IT and ICS, an appropriate place to cut costs without creating vulnerabilities is in the connections between IT and ICS networks.
False
## Can using cloud technology introduce additional vulnerabilities?
Yes. An exploit could expand throughout the entire information infrastructure.
## Why do legacy control systems contribute to ICS vulnerabilities? (Select all that apply.)
They were not designed to provide protection from modern-day attacks.,
They may not be updated with protective mechanisms.,
They were designed to be used on systems isolated from untrusted networks.
## Which of the following expedites unauthorized system penetration?
Hard-coded/easy passwords
## Which of the following makes it easier to run malware and exploit code?
No authentication of new applications
## Which of the following provides traffic analysis with malicious intent?
Plain text traffic
## Which of the following is a concession for availability that can result in poor security coding?
Guaranteed high availability
## As business computer systems increased in power and speed, which of the following were adopted for monitoring and controlling industrial processes?
Commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and operating systems
## For each commercial-off-the-shelf operating system vulnerability, every ICS using that operating system is vulnerable to the same weakness.
True
## Which of the following refers to the shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices associated with cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity culture
## Why does adding functionality and capability to field devices create a target-rich environment for an attacker?
The field device is connected directly to ICS components which monitor and control process equipment.
## Which of the following make it possible to attack a control system by intentionally issuing unauthorized set points, or resetting the PLC to create a denial of service while not being onsite?
Remote connectivity
## Unsecured and unpatched third-party applications can provide a vulnerability exploitable by an attacker.
True
## Which of the following works to reduce risks within and across all critical infrastructure sectors by partnering with law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community?
The Department of Homeland Security's Cyber + Infrastructure
## Which of the following are vulnerabilities repeatedly seen during assessments and DHS' CISA Incident Response Investigations? (Select all that apply.)
Weak firewall rules,Poor network design,Lack of formal documentation
## It is appropriate to ask vendors what they do to prevent vulnerabilities in their products.
True
